Kaggle hosted a competition from November 16, 2018 to March 30, 2019.  The challenge asked participants to create an algorithm for binary classification to identify images as either: having no cancerous tumor or as having a cancerous tumor.

The PatchCamelyon (PCam) dataset contains color images which are 96 by 96 pixels of lymph node biopsies. The images include a label identifying whether the tissue contained tumor tissue or not. A label of one denotes the presence of a cancerous tumor -- whereas zero denotes no cancerous tissue. The original dataset consists of 327680 instances. The dataset posted on Kaggle was modified from the original to remove duplicates. The dataset posted on Kaggle contained over 220000 images and labels.

For this assignment, we were asked to utilize the PCam dataset summarized above to conduct analysis of the images and build CNN models for binary classification. The data was split into training and validation sets, in order to monitor the performance of these models on the validation data.  The best performing models were identified, as well as the associated hyperparameters.  

Screenshots are also included from the Kaggle site reflecting the models' performance on the test data.
